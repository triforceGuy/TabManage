Research How to Upload Picture and Apply It

Since I am totally new to Javascript/HTML/CSS, I need to learn how to upload/apply the image to the extension.
In this research, I need to research 2 things. First is learning the implementation of uploading user's image and apply to the background theme.
Second is identifying which file and which codes in our extension(Tab Manager Plus) is related to the background theme.

As a result of the research, I need to add new css file in css folder and set width/height/position of the image, and then I need to add new Javascript file to implement uploadinf image.

This research is related to the tasks "Create a function that allow user can upload picture" and "Create a function that apply user's picture to the background theme"
