    The 90's theme is inspired by Lisa Frank. The psychedelic colors of the stationary she created were enticing
    to many in the 80's and 90's. The current resell market on her now vintage items is blowing up! We've also seen many
    brands use the vibrant combination of colors to impart a sense of nostalgia.
    
    So why not join the craze with this cool theme!

    Here's a preview of the 90's theme. More enhancements coming soon!

    In the settings page, the 90's color palette with an explosion of pink glitter is displayed.
