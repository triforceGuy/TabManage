There is a window color change function in Window.js and Window.jsx (pick the dedsire color from 25 choices of colors in popup.css). There also pin tab and show duclicates functionality do change color of tab icons. I can reuse these code and css for the color choice, and I will modify them for changing tab icons' color function.
It seems to need to create new section in popup.css for "tabcolor" that program can identify which color will be used to change color of tab icons. We also need to show popup window to choose desire colors like Window.js and Windw.jsx do for changing window color.
