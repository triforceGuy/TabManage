When working on this extension I thought it would be different from working on a webpage.
After doing more research on https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-image 
and https://www.w3schools.com/csSref/pr_background-image.php and trying it out for myself, I realized that this
web extension is very similar to a regular webpage.
