Research how to request and store login passwords

I am doing this in order to implement functional log in functions so that we can later use login credentials for purposes such as saving the users profile. As well as other functions yet to be decided. Through this research I also hope to brush up a bit on my html, css and javascript.

I expect to learn how to store and request passwords safely. I also expect to learn a bit about how to implement menu options as well as on click functions. I do not have a lot of practice with front end work so learning how to use buttons is an added bonus.

I expect to use this research to implement part of the log in class. (more specifically the password section)

The tasks dependent on this research that I will do are.
    1.) Create a function that prompts a user to create a password.
    2.) Create a functino that makes the user's password have to meet requirements.
    3.) Create test cases for passwords.
