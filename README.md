# Tab Manager Project
> 1.) Bianca Dominguez, Eri Midorikawa, Jessy Estrada, Nickolas Miller, Sarah Davidson

> 2.) We are creating extension that will allow users to organize browser tabs to their liking. 

> 3.) Our target audience is anyone who often bookmarks their browser tabs. 

> 4.) Our tab organizer will help make surfing the web easier. Instead of having multiple tabs open and having to jump between tabs, everything will be categorized and organized; making it faster and easier for the user.

> Live demo soon! [_here_](https://www.example.com). <!-- If you have the project hosted somewhere, include the link here. -->
