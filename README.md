# Tab Manager Project
Authors: Bianca Dominguez, Eri Midorikawa, Jessy Estrada, Nickolas Miller, Sarah Davidson

Our team is creating an extension that will allow users to organize their browser tabs. Our target audience is any internet browser that has more than a couple tabs open at a time and can benefit from some organization. This tab organizer will help make surfing the web easier for everyone who finds it difficult or tedious to find a tab you’re looking for.

## General Information
As our team took on the role of editing and modifying the tab extension, we realized that there were some features that we ourselves would have loved to have been implemented. So we took on the task of adding those additions and then some.  

- 1.) here is a link to a picture that I think would be a cute for an icon and we can take as an inspiration: 
		![Remote Image](https://images.app.goo.gl/BCYj9Pmxtn1xUD467)
		
	
- 2.) I think a little more expertise and money couldn't hurt :)

## Setup
**Requirements**

Since our Tab Manager is not currently available on the Chrome Extensions store, in order to access the Tab Manager Google Chrome Extension you must go to Manage Extensions on your Chrome Browser and allow Developer Mode on the top right corner. 

	Step 1: Download all files from link 
	Step 2: Open the chrome browser 
	Step 3: Click the settings in the top right (the three verticle dots) 
	Step 4: Hover above the "more tools" and select "extensions" 
	Step 5: Click "Load Unpacked" and navigate to file you saved from the link and select it.

At this point a puzzle piece will appear on the chrome browser (just to the right of the bookmark star) if no other extensions have been installed.

To start the extension, click the puzzle piece and select the tab organizer extension that you just installed.

<a name="next-steps"></a>
## Next Steps
- Eri:　I will work on research what is wrong with my feature I added (changing background image) and will fix it. 
- Sarah: I will be working with Nick on integrating out login functions. Then work with improving the login system with a better database. 
- Nick: I will be working with Sarah on finishing the login functions and connecting it with our app. In addition to this adding a registration   feature is important. 
- Jessy: My part is going to create the buttons on the system settings page as well implement the new theme for our extension.
- Bianca: I'll work closely with Jessy to implement the functionality and theme changes we presentented on in class. 

<a name="retro"></a>
## Retrospective
	- What Went Well?:
		- The whole team worked really together. 
		- Our team knows how to accomplish a goal and everyone is held accountable.
		- We have great communication when we do communicate.
		- Nick: We learn well together because we all help each other out.
		Eri: We could collaborate very well in terms of splitting tasks and communicate about tasks.
		Sarah: I think our team has a good balance and we all respect and work well with each other.
		Nick: I will be working with Sarah on finishing the login functions and connecting it with our app. In addition to this adding a registration feature is important. 
		Jessy: I believe that our communication actually was really well for our first time working together. Everyone came together and helped one another when stuck with an issue. Really good team chemistry.
		Bianca: I learned so much already about chrome extensions, the team really helped with this by showing me how to run/edit files.
	- What can I do better?:
		Eri: I have to understand more about the existing code. My first sprint took way longer than my estimate and did not work well due to the lack of knowleadge about REACT/HTML/Javascript/CSS.
		Sarah: I can do better about actually pulling from the master and practicing git. 
		Nick: I can split up my work into smaller parts in order to push more frequently. This sprint I had one large commit rather than smaller ones. One thing that can help me imporve upon this is doing a better job planning the code out better prior to working on it.
		Jessy: I know that I can do better staying on top of the chat. I didn't have the notifications on for so long but just recently turned them on.
		Bianca: I can stay on top of my tasks better. To make sure I implement this change, I will complete and move my tasks over throughout the week instead of at the very end.
	- What Might Be Impeding Us from Performing Better?
	Our team can benefit from communicating more often. It would also be helpful if we pulled from master so that we had less conflicts in our files. 
	We can also do a better job at having more specific goals in mind when planning our sprint. Understanding the existing code and sharing our knowledge will also benefit us.
	Our team can also benefit from a greater understanding of react in general.

	- Pushing to next sprint

	<a name="next-steps2"></a>
## Next Steps
- Eri:　I will work on add color changing function on the button I created. After that, I will research how to sort tabs with colors
- Sarah: I will refactor my login and link it to the button Nick created on the webpage. Then I can link my registration page. 
- Nick: I will be working on finishing the webpage's updates section. I will also be refactoring the stylized components to fit all screens rather than just my home pc. I will also work with Sarah as best I can to help her connect the login to the webpage.
- Jessy: I honestly don't know what I want to do other than build a space ship. I will honeslty try to find other things to maybe come up with and ask my team members what kind of things I could work on and I can also brainstorm to find better optimizations for our project.
- Bianca: I will polish up the 90's glitter theme and create functionality so that you can only have one theme at a time. If time permits,
			I'm also interested in helping Eri with how to sort tabs.

## Retrospective for Sprint 2
	- What Went Well?:
		- The team works well together. 
		- The changes we made are visible and show progress. (Kudos to Nick for the cool webpage.)
		- We have made progress going through all the files from the original code. 
		- As a team, we have a clear vision for our future implementations.
		
		Eri: Thanks to Dr. Lehr's help/resources, I could go over our existing code and understand better in this sprint.
		Sarah: I think this sprint we were able to get a lot of the fundamentals needed down from a complex code base. Thanks to the help of Dr. Lehr I am finally able to pull from the master. 
		Nick: I think that this sprint we did a better job of narrowing down 
		what we want to work on. It felt like the first sprint we had a lot of ideas so we were scattered.
		Jessy: Sprint 1 was the prototype of us working together. Our second sprint we really knew how to talk to each other and would talk after class more about changed and improvement. We ultimatly just did better in communication and also in teamwork. Our Slack is also really alive now, and we are daily, if not constantly, shooting messages to each other. 
		Bianca: I think we had more direction this sprint because of the research we did in sprint 1.
	- What Might Be Impeding Us from Performing Better?
	Our team can benefit from going to each other for help or learning together. Some parts of the
	project are difficult to understand so if we leaned on each other for more support we would all
	come out of this experience with more knowledge.
	- What can I do to improve?
		Eri: I still need to understand better how to use gitKraken and how git works. I often commit/push/merge on wrong branches accidentally, and it took a good amount of time to fix these mistake
		Sarah: I can make sure that now that I am able to pull from the master that I do so. And I code in my working directory and psuh more frequently. 
		Nick: I can improve upon making my pushes better quality. When I pushed to master I usually pushed before I was completely done with the task I was working on. I did this specifically in my create a form of navigation task. I made the sidebar but did not finish connecting it to the other pages before pushing it to master and then finished connecting it on my next task.
		Jessy: I have only been sticking to my side of the project and not worrying or trying to understand what the other people are doing. I can do a better job of actually understanding what is going on so not only can I learn it, but do a better job presenting the content for our final sprint.
		Bianca: I can offer my help to teamates that are struggling with difficult tasks. I might not be able to solve the problem but we
				can bounce ideas off of each other that would help.
